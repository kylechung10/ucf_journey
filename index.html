                        I got my first UCF experience in my freshmen year of highschool, my old sister
                        was looking and applying to colleges. When she got accepted to UCF she took a tour,
                        and knowing I would have to start thinking about college soon I also attended the tour.
                        Also, one of my projects for a class was to visit a college campus and write a report about it.
                        Lucky me I was already going to UCF, so this project was going be straight forward. I loved the 
                        atmosphere of the campus as soon as I stepped foot onto it. Fast forward 4 years to my highschool
                        graduation, our highschool held graduations at UCF and at this time I already got accepted into UCF,
                        so I knew this was first, but not last time graduating at the UCF arena.

                    I enrolled at UCF as an mechanical engineering major, and I am grateful
                    for that experience even though I switched majors down the road. Starting off
                    as an engineering major taught me quick that college would not be easy and you
                    had to put hours of effort to get the results you wanted. The classes were extremely
                    demnanding, but due to that I met many lifelong friends. Most engineers were "car guys",
                    so I generally found it easy to make friends with them. This got me into automotive photography
                    and sparked the beginning of my creativity at UCF. Although the pictures were mediocre, it 
                    taught me the basics.

                    After a year and a half of mechanical engineering I decided that it was not something
                    I wanted to pursue anymore, therefore switching my major to Digital Media: Web Design.
                    Every class I took within the Web Design track fully interested me and I looked for other 
                    ways to express my art. Having the love for cars I began to take more pictures eventually buying
                    a professional camera. I loved that I could use my knowledge I learned from class and apply it to
                    my hobby.

                    I am currently enjoying the Digital Media major and everyone I met within my classes.
                    I will soon turn my photography into a side business as I have taken some friends graduation photos.
                    The move downtown for my major was a big change for my schedule as commuting takes a long time. currently
                    that is my only complaint about the major.
